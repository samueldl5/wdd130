        <p>Chile is the longest (from north to south) country in the world! Interesting facts about it could be that it
            has the top 1 driest desert on the world (the Atacama Desert), it is home of the Easter Island, famous for
            its Moai statues and
            for being one of the most
            remote inhabited islands; and its clear skies on the north of the country offers astronomers
            ideal conditions for research.</p>
