        <p>Hello! My name is Samuel Dom√≠nguez Lagos, I'm from Chile. I enjoy exercising/working out, eating, sleeping,
            learning new things and spending quality time with my loved ones. One thing I'm into right now is coding, in
            part that's why I am in this fabulous
            virtual place as it is BYU Pathway Worldwide! As I continue in this path, I hope we can all have an amazing
            time together. I'm grateful to have this opportunity, or blessing, of being here.</p>
        <p>Since learning by study and faith are two things strongly interconnected in this place (which I love), I
            would like to take the opportunity here to share one of my favorite passages that I've been
            understanding more and more lately. It is
            Mosiah 4:27, quote: "And see that all these things are done in
            <strong>wisdom</strong> and <strong>order</strong>; for it is not requisite that a man should <strong>run
                faster
                than he
                has strength</strong>. And again, it is expedient that he should be <strong>diligent</strong>, that
            thereby he might
            <strong>win the prize</strong>;
            therefore, all
            things must be done in <strong>order</strong>." I love how this Scripture tell us a principle of prudency
            concerning
            service, which can be applied to all other areas, including how helpful it could be to our efforts of
            seeking light and truth; but
            beyond this, I treasure how it shows the kind of
            <strong>prudency</strong> that originates in the Lord Himself, that He can give. I ponder how it explains
            more
            about His nature
            and the kind of relationship we can have (yoking).
            That's all reader, thank you for
            taking your time here!

        <p>Chile is the longest (from north to south) country in the world! Interesting facts about it could be that it
            has the top 1 driest desert on the world (the Atacama Desert), it is home of the Easter Island, famous for
            its Moai statues and
            for being one of the most
            remote inhabited islands; and its clear skies on the north of the country offers astronomers
            ideal conditions for research.</p>
